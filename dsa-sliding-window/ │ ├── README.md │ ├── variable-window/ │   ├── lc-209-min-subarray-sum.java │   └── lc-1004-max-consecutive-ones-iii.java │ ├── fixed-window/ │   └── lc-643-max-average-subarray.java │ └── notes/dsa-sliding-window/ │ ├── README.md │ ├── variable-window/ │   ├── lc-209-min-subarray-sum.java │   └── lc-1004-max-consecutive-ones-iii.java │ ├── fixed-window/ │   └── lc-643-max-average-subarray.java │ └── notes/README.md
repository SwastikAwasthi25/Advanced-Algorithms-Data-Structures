# Sliding Window – DSA Practice (Java)

This repository contains my practice and understanding of the **Sliding Window pattern**
using Java, implemented as part of structured DSA preparation.

## 🧠 Patterns Covered
- Fixed Size Sliding Window
- Variable Size Sliding Window
- At Most K Constraint

## 📂 Folder Structure
- `fixed-window/` → problems with constant window size
- `variable-window/` → problems with dynamic window size
- `notes/` → conceptual notes and pattern breakdowns

## ✅ Problems Implemented

### Variable Window
- **LeetCode 209** – Minimum Size Subarray Sum  
- **LeetCode 1004** – Max Consecutive Ones III  

### Fixed Window
- **LeetCode 643** – Maximum Average Subarray I  

## 🧩 Key Learnings
- Window is never reset, only expanded and shrunk
- Nested while loops still run in O(n) (amortized)
- Right pointer expands, left pointer shrinks
- Constraints define when to shrink

## 🚀 Language
- Java

## 📌 Status
More patterns and problems will be added incrementally.
